## 🎛️ *Control - send your friends onto the lifthill*
* Be the person behind the buttons! You decide whether the ride is safe for dispatch or not. 
* Not interested in being behind the controls, or no player online to control the ride? No problem! Put the ride in automatic mode!

**And with the advanced ride monitoring system, you know where all trains are, without even seeing them!**
