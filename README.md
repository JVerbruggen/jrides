# **jrides** - Bring coasters to your Minecraft server!
![Maven build](https://github.com/JVerbruggen/jrides/workflows/Maven%20build/badge.svg) 


'jrides' is an open-source rollercoaster animator for Minecraft Spigot. Super-smoothly animated coasters within the snap of a finger. 

✨ **No mods required!** ✨

## 🎢 *Ride - go inside your own rides*
* With jrides, you can enter any ride you create. Whether it is a launched, inverted or water coaster.

## 🎛️ *Control - send your friends onto the lift-hill*
* Be the person behind the buttons! You decide whether the ride is safe for dispatch or not. 
* Not interested in being behind the controls, or no player online to control the ride? No problem! Put the ride in automatic mode!

**And with the advanced ride monitoring system, you know where all trains are, without even seeing them!**

## 🚠 *Go sideways - hyper-mobile transfers*
* Besides going forward, your coaster can go sideways, if you want! Use transfers to push a train sideways, upwards, or even roll it on its side.
